         Create a memory manager object, allocate address spaces for several
         processes, then print the memory map.
        
         Deallocate a few address spaces, and print the memory map again.
        
         Allocate a few smaller address spaces, which will end up being
         allocated in between larger, already allocated address spaces, then
         print the memory map again.
        
         Please label each of your memory map printouts with a description of the
         current situation, so the reader of the console has context for the 
         status of the memory map at that point, e.g.
         "Just deallocated pids 35 44 and 51. Printing the memory map."
